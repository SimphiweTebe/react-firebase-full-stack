## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A javascript library for creating SPA and handling the UI.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - Handles page routing
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - For animation and transitions
- [Contentful API](https://www.contentful.com/) - Headless Content Management 

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Building carousel from scratch](https://www.newline.co/@andreeamaco/react-carousel-building-the-component-from-scratch-vs-using-a-library--7da468d4) - This helped me create a custom carousel from blueprint scratch. But I used GSAP for animation instead of Slick carousel. Plan on using GSAP through out the App.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
